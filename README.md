# COLOR-SWITCH-AP-PROJECT
## Final Advanced programming project: A java implementation of color switch game
- The objective of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by manoeuvring the obstacles. 
- Upon hitting any obstacle, one can continue with your earned stars or the game ends and have to start from the beginning.
- We developed the endless (infinity) game mode of the classic gameplay. 
- As the game progresses, the game becomes difficult, which is achieved by creating different kinds of obstacles. 
- The Stars collected are used to resurrect the ball in case the ball hits an obstacle.
- One can save the state of the game upon pausing.To save the state of game at any point in time, we store: 
  1. The stars collected
  2. The exact position of the ball
  3. The position of the obstacles and their orientation
